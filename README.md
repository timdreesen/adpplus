## Features

### Core Functionality
- **One-click ability scanning** -- machine learning identifies all 48 abilities in the draft pool from a single screenshot
- **Real-time overlay** -- recommendations appear directly on top of the Dota 2 game screen
- **Synergy detection** -- highlights overpowered (OP) ability combinations and trap combinations to avoid
- **Triplet analysis** -- suggests the best third ability to complete known strong pairs
- **Top-tier picks** -- up to 10 ranked recommendations, prioritizing synergies with your already-picked abilities
- **Rescan** -- update recommendations after abilities are drafted

### Smart Overlay
- **Click-through transparency** -- overlay sits on top of the game without blocking gameplay
- **My Spot / My Model** -- select your hero position and model for personalized recommendations
- **Ability tooltips** -- hover any ability for detailed stats, synergies, and win rates
- **Hero model tooltips** -- hover hero models for hero-specific ability synergies
- **OP & Trap panels** -- scrollable lists of the best and worst ability combinations in the current pool

### Data & ML
- **Windrun.io integration** -- one-click data scraping from the premier Ability Draft statistics site
- **524-class ML model** -- MobileNetV2 INT8 quantized, with optional DirectML GPU acceleration
- **Automatic resolution detection** -- works out of the box for 28 common resolutions, with mathematical auto-scaling for others
- **Calibration wizard** -- 4-anchor calibration for non-standard resolution setups

### Quality of Life
- **Dark mode** -- follows your system theme, or set manually to light/dark
- **English & Russian** -- full interface localization
- **Auto-updater** -- in-app notifications when a new version is available
- **Database backups** -- automatic backups on startup, manual backup/restore from Settings
- **Windowed mode** -- automatic game window tracking for non-fullscreen setups

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. Launch the application
2. Go to the **Data** page in the sidebar
3. Click **Update Windrun Data** to fetch the latest ability and hero statistics from Windrun.io
4. Wait for all three phases to complete (abilities, synergy pairs, triplets)

### During a Game

1. Click **Activate Overlay** on the Dashboard before starting the game or after starting it but before queueing
2. The overlay will appear on top of your game
3. Queue for an **Ability Draft** match in Dota 2
4. When the draft screen appears and is fully loaded click **Initial Scan** on the overlay control panel (top-right corner)
5. Review the highlighted abilities in the pool:
   - **Green shimmer** -- general top-tier picks (highest combined winrate + pick priority score)
   - **Blue/teal shimmer** -- synergy suggestions (abilities that pair well with your already-picked abilities, shown after selecting My Spot)
   - **Gold shimmer** -- top-tier hero model (on the hero model slots)
   - **Solid teal border** -- your own picked abilities (after selecting My Spot)
   - **Solid green border** -- your selected hero model (after selecting My Model)
6. Hover abilities for detailed tooltips with synergy information
7. Use the **OP Combos** and **Trap Combos** panels for combination analysis
8. After abilities are drafted, click **Rescan** to update recommendations
9. Click **Close** to dismiss the overlay or **Reset** to closes scan but leave overlay open

### Selecting Your Hero

- Click **My Spot** on a hero position to tell the app at which position you're playing -- this personalizes recommendations to show synergies with your already-picked abilities
- Click **My Model** on a hero model to indicate which hero model is yours

### Resolution Support

The app automatically detects your game resolution and selects the correct coordinate layout. Pre-mapped coordinates are included for 28 common resolutions (1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160, ultrawide, and more). For resolutions without a preset, the app mathematically scales coordinates from the nearest base resolution for your aspect ratio family. No manual setup is needed in the vast majority of cases.
